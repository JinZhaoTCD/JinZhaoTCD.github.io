# PhD students

I worked as task lead on the follwoing DOE, DOD, and PNNL sponsered projects.

* **DOD-ESTCP -- Model-Free Adaptive Control for Autonomous and Resilient Operation of Microgrids**

I conducted a few groups of work under this project, including: 1) Inverter PQ control with trajectory tracking capability based on physical-informed reinforcement learning; 2) Decentralized and coordinated V-f control for islanded microgrids considering DER adequacy and demand control; 3) Virtual inertia scheduling for real-time economic dispatch of IBR-penetrated power system; 4) Virtual inertia scheduling for microgrids with static and dynamic security constraints

* **DOE -- Large Scale Testbed for Cyber-physical Power Grid Simulation**

I contributed to the development [large scale testbed (LTB)](https://ltb.curent.org/) for cyber-physical power grid simulation. Specifically, a power market simulator [AMS](https://docs.andes.app/en/latest/?badge=latest). Check teams on the [website](https://ltb.curent.org/team/).

* **DOE -- Advanced Grid Modeling of Future Power Systems**

I developed an analytical EMT model of inverter-based microgrids and proposed a controller design approach with guaranteed large signal stability. The approach is validated through power hardware-in-the-loop experiments in [CURENT HTB](https://curent.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tolbert_Fact_Sheet_Web.pdf)

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Control Oriented Models for Co-design Optimization**

I developed an EMT model of a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD, integrating offshore wind farms, IBRs, and HVDC/MTDC. This model was transformed from PSS/e using ETran. Additionally, I developed analytical and numerical wind turbine models in Python using Sympy.

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Multi-Objective Co-design Optimization for Pareto-Set Identification**

I developed dynamic constraints for power system co-design (planning) problems. This work is tailored for offshore wind farms connected to the main grid through HVDC/MTDC, and equipped with frequency support capabilities.

* **PNNL-LDRD -- Predictive Risk Informed Data-driven Resilient Controls**

I developed a dispatch-dynamic co-simulation platform for power systems. This platform emulates denial-of-service and false data injection attacks, integrating them into the workflow for batch data generation and computational attack detection.
